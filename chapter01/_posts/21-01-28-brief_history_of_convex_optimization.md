## Theory (convex analysis)
ca1900 - 1970

## Algorithms

* 1947: simplex algorithm for linear programming (Dantzig)
* 1960s: early interior-point methods (Fiacco & McCormick, Dikin, . . . )
* 1970s: ellipsoid method and other subgradient methods
* 1980s: polynomial-time interior-point methods for linear programming (Karmarkar 1984)
* late 1980sâ€“now: polynomial-time interior-point methods for nonlinear convex optimization (Nesterov & Nemirovski 1994)

## Applications
* before 1990: mostly in operations research; few in engineering
* since 1990: many new applications in engineering (control, signal processing, communications, circuit design, . . . ); new problem classes (semidefinite and second-order cone programming, robust optimization)
